 A Data Analysis Project using Power BI
1. PURPOSE:
This project focuses on analyzing Blinkit’s grocery sales data using **Power BI** to derive actionable business insights. The dataset includes over **8,500+ sales records** across multiple cities and product categories.
The goal was to build a **dynamic, interactive dashboard** that enables stakeholders to monitor performance, identify trends, and support strategic decisions.

The project revealed valuable insights like high-revenue regions, underperforming products, and seasonal sales trends. These insights help the business optimize stock, pricing, and promotional strategies for better customer satisfaction and increased profitability.
